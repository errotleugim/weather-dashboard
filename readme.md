This is a website that uses the Openweathermap One Call API.
It renders the weather of the day in the queried city, as well as an overview of the next six days.
Functions that work:
-Current Weather
-Extended Weather
-UV Index check.
Missing functions:
-Last cities searched
-Icons

UI isnt pretty, but i've no more time to modify it.
